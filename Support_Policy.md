## FAQ ##
  * Adblock Plus does NOT block ADwares nor malwares themselves, which generate ADs. Remove them BEFORE reporting ADs.
  * Filters for the following scripts will **never be added** to ABP Japanese Filters (abp\_jp.txt) because **erroneous customizations by web site owner** lead to too many annoying false FALSE POSITIVE reports, which is **not my fault**.
